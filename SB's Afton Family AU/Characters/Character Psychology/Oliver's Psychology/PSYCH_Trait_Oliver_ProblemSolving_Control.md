# üõ†Ô∏è Emotional Control via Invention

Oliver instinctively "solves" emotional or interpersonal tension with mechanical solutions. Whether it‚Äôs gifting Willow boy-repellent disguised as perfume or automating parenting tasks through surveillance tech, he bypasses emotional labor with technical ingenuity.

This reflects:
- Avoidance of vulnerability
- A worldview that equates emotional conflict with engineering challenges
- A deep discomfort with messiness‚Äîespecially emotional unpredictability

His children inherit this pattern, often repressing feelings or trying to "optimize" their emotional lives, mirroring Oliver‚Äôs behavior.
