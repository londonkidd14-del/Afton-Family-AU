Oliver's Orphanage Repression
**Period:** Ages 16–18

- **Post-Asylum Life:** Sent to orphanage. Perceived as "functional," though emotionally detached.
    
- **Therapeutic Sabotage:** A manipulative psychiatrist introduces a distorted version of Oliver’s Wonderland as a coping tool, framing it as healing while using it to bury trauma.
    
- **Long-Term Impact:** Suppression of trauma leads to growing mental distortion and eventual memory fragmentation.
