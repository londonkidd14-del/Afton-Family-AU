- **Behavior:** Solves interpersonal/emotional tension with mechanical or technical solutions rather than direct emotional engagement.
    
- **Implications:** Avoids vulnerability; reframes emotional conflict as an engineering challenge; uncomfortable with unpredictability.
    
- **Intergenerational Effect:** Willow internalizes this pattern, often repressing emotions or “optimizing” family relationships.
    

### **3. Emotional Masking & Detachment**

- **Symptoms:** Deflection with humor or ego, feigned apathy, framing care as obligation or invention.
    
- **Impact:** Children struggle to read intentions; trust and emotional intimacy are eroded.
    

### **4. Cyclic Undermining Behavior (Parenting Style)**

- **Behavior:** Oscillates between mentorship and subtle sabotage.
    
- **Examples:** Minimizes accomplishments, guilt-trips, holds favors over heads, undercuts praise with backhanded jabs.
    
- **Outcome:** Leaves children craving approval, fostering perfectionism, repression, and validation-seeking behaviors.
    

### **5. Post-Traumatic Dissociation**

- **Origin:** Childhood/adolescent fire trauma, survivor’s guilt, feelings of abandonment.
    
- **Symptoms:** Derealization, altered memory perception, disembodiment under stress.
    
- **Behavioral Outcome:** Hyper-controlling habits, emotional avoidance, reliance on structure and invention for stability.
    

### **6. Cognitive Hyperfunction**

- **Risks:** Boredom-induced depression, over-rationalization of emotions, existential crises.
    
- **Effect on Relationships:** Intellectual dominance can alienate others, reinforcing isolation and need for control.
