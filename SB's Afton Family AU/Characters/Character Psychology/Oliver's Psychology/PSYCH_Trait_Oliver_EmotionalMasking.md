# ðŸŽ­ Emotional Masking & Detachment

Oliver rarely expresses genuine vulnerability. He wraps affection in sarcasm, withholds praise, and delivers emotional intimacy through cryptic backhanded compliments. His discomfort with closeness often manifests as:

- Deflection with humor or ego
- Feigned apathy
- Framing care as obligation or invention

This makes it difficult for his children to read his intentions. Even when he *does* care deeply, his delivery erodes trust and creates a chronic need for validation.
