# ðŸ§  Cyclic Undermining Behavior (Parenting Style)

Oliver oscillates between manipulation and rare bursts of mentorship. While he offers practical support and technological tools, his parenting is tinged with competitiveness and subtle sabotage.

Behaviors include:
- Minimizing his children's accomplishments
- Guilt-tripping and "I did this for you" logic
- Holding past favors over their heads
- Undercutting praise with backhanded jabs

This erodes the autonomy of Willow and William, leaving them craving approval from someone who rarely gives it unconditionally.
