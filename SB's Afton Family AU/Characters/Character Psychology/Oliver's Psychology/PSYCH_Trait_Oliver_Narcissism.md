# 🔍 Vulnerable Narcissism – Oliver Afton

Oliver presents classic signs of *vulnerable narcissism*, characterized by hypersensitivity to criticism, passive-aggressive control, and emotional fragility masked by superiority. Unlike grandiose narcissists, Oliver avoids direct boasts but subtly centers himself in conversations and decisions.

He is self-important but also anxious, often retreating when his authority is questioned. His intelligence reinforces the belief that others “just don’t understand,” driving a wedge between him and his children even when he believes he's being supportive.

> He doesn't *seek praise*—he *needs to be right*.
