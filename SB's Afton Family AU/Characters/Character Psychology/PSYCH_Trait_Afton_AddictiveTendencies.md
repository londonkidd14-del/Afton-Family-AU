# 🧬 Afton Genetic Profile: Addictive Tendencies

The Afton bloodline shows elevated susceptibility to addictive behavior—ranging from substances (alcohol, stimulants) to stimuli (work, thrill-seeking). In Oliver’s case, these traits amplify under stress or intellectual stagnation.

Traits include:
- Restlessness during periods of low stimulation
- Substance use tied to burnout or self-worth spirals
- Tendency to overcompensate with “big wins” (e.g., trying to blow up the sun)

Willow and William inherit this tendency in emotional form—struggling with burnout, insomnia, and hyperfixation on productivity or self-perfection.
