#### üß† Character Note ‚Äì Mafioso Influence

William inherited a pragmatic, loyalty-first mindset from his mother, **Judith Afton**, who came from a Mafia family. Judith‚Äôs code of emotional restraint, strategic loyalty, and survival-based decision-making deeply influenced his worldview.

He internalized a version of "family above all" that shaped how he approached every part of his life ‚Äî from business to morality. For William, protecting his family is the _only non-negotiable_, even if that means making cold, damaging, or ethically gray choices.
