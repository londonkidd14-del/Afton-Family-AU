#### 🕵️ Character Note – Public Confusion

Due to William’s intensely private nature and minimal public presence, the general public often confused him and the Afton family with another individual: **Dave Miller** and the Miller family. 
The confusion led to legal and media mix-ups, further obscuring the truth behind Fazbear Entertainment’s internal structure and contributing to William’s mythologized reputation after his disappearance.

**Dave Miller** a white British man and former day/night guard employed at Fredbear's Family Diner during its early years. He proved himself to be highly competent in day-to-day operations and gradually climbed the corporate ladder due to his aptitude for business management and logistics. Though unrelated to the Afton family, his name became accidentally tied to several of their incidents in public records, further muddying the waters for investigators and theorists alike. Interestingly, the Miller family physically resembled what later became the stereotypical 'canon' image of the Afton family in popular media — pale skin, light brown hair, and stylized facial structures — which further fueled public confusion and fan-created misidentifications.

Behind closed doors, however, Dave Miller was not the benign manager the public believed him to be. In a dark twist buried by rumor and misidentification, Dave was responsible for the murder of Charlotte Emily — not William Afton. Due to his physical resemblance to the public’s fixation on the 'Afton mythos,' suspicion never fell on him directly. Dave weaponized this confusion, allowing William’s name and legacy to absorb the fallout while he remained hidden in plain sight. This false attribution played a significant role in Henry Emily’s psychological collapse, as he believed for years that his closest colleague had murdered his daughter.

In addition to Charlotte, Dave Miller is also responsible for the deaths of four children: Gabriel, Susie, Jeremy, and Fritz. While the full motive remains unknown, the pattern of their disappearances is undeniable, and ties back to Miller’s time working within Fazbear properties. These deaths were long believed to be the work of William Afton — a misconception that shielded the true culprit and enabled Dave to act without scrutiny.

While neither William Afton nor Henry Emily directly killed the children, they bear a degree of responsibility by association. As senior figures within Fazbear Entertainment, both men were in positions of power during Dave Miller’s employment. His actions, however concealed, occurred under their watch. This lingering accountability continues to haunt their legacies, particularly William’s — who was vilified in Dave’s place — and Henry’s — who trusted the wrong man and misjudged the danger inside his own system.

Adding another layer of distortion, Fazbear Entertainment themselves capitalized on the confusion and conspiracy theories by developing a series of horror-themed video games loosely based on public rumors, urban legends, and speculation about the Afton family and the company's darker history. These games, which mirror the real-world 'FNAF' franchise, were deliberately exaggerated and stylized, allowing Fazbear Entertainment to dismiss real allegations as fictional storytelling while profiting off the mystique.
