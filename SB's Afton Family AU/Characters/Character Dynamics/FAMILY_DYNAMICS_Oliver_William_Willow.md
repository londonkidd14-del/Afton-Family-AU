## 🧬 William & Willow Afton’s Relationship with Oliver (Expanded)

### 🧠 Oliver James Afton:
- **Caring but controlling** — Oliver *does* love his children, but that love often comes with unspoken **conditions**: obedience, performance, intellectual rigor. When his expectations are unmet, he uses **guilt, subtle put-downs, or conditional praise** rather than open hostility.
- **Emotional manipulation as control:** He frames personal failures as *family betrayals* to keep William and Willow aligned to his worldview.

### 🛠️ Habitual Fixer, Avoids Feelings
- He replaces emotional repair with **technological problem-solving**: a lab upgrade instead of an apology, a gift of knowledge instead of reassurance.
- This indirectly teaches William and Willow that **feelings are inefficiencies**, something to be *optimized* or *solved*, not *sat with*.

### 🔁 Inherited Ego
- Both William and Willow **inherited Oliver’s ego**, but neither fully knows what to do with it.
- **Willow** possesses a quiet, internalized sense of intellectual superiority, but it's constantly checked by her self-esteem issues. She’ll enter a room knowing she’s probably right… then spend the rest of the conversation doubting herself.
- **William’s ego** runs closer to the surface. He’s bolder in his convictions and resents being second-guessed, but his confidence is brittle — it fractures under rejection or failure.

### 🧠 Manipulation, Narcissism, and Conditional Love
- Oliver, whether **deliberately or unconsciously**, often **undermines** Willow and William’s accomplishments. He manipulates through **guilt**, **gaslighting**, or **occasional emotional outbursts**, using his intelligence as a tool of dominance rather than connection.
- While not always malicious, Oliver is **somewhat narcissistic**, frequently leveraging his children to pursue **his own goals**, often without consideration for their emotional or physical limits.
- Despite their genius and competence, **William and Willow still crave his approval** — a need rooted in childhood **neglect and emotional abuse.** Their drive to succeed is inseparable from the hope that one day, Oliver will finally acknowledge them *without conditions*.

### 🧠 Fleeting Moments of Bonding
- Occasionally, the three bond over shared **intellect**, **sarcasm**, or **disdain for mediocrity**. These moments give William and Willow **a flicker of hope** — that maybe he can change, or already has.
- But those moments are rare. And they never last long.
