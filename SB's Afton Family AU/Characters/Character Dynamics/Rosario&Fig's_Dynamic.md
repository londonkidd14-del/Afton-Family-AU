# Rosario&Fig's_Dynamic
### ðŸ§© Context:
After Williamâ€™s disappearance and Nicoâ€™s coma, Rosario legally adopted Fig. However, their bond was never especially close beforehandâ€”they coexisted more than they connected.

---

### ðŸ§  Emotional Climate (Early 1990sâ€“mid 90s):
- **Rosario** was emotionally frayed, grieving, and mentally unwellâ€”barely functioning as a guardian.
- **Fig** processed her grief through frustration and withdrawal. She didnâ€™t resent Rosario, but the lack of structure hurt.
- The household was under-supported despite the occasional involvement of extended family (Willow, Judith, Oliver, Henry).

---

### ðŸ’¥ Strains:
- Miscommunication, emotional distance, and Rosarioâ€™s poor self-care created a rift.
- Fig struggled with abandonment issues and a perceived need to become emotionally self-sufficient.
- Rosario internalized guilt for failing Fig during her most vulnerable years.

### ðŸ”„ Gradual Shift:
While still complicated, later years saw improvement:
- Rosario starts rebuilding himself.
- Fig learns to express frustration and hurt in healthier ways.
- Their relationship shifts from one of reluctant co-survival to a hesitant, slowly warming sibling-parent bond.
