| **Identity**                   | William Afton — “Nightguard turned suspected killer.”                                                                   | William Afton — Co-founder of Fazbear Entertainment, robotics innovator, original nightguard for cost-cutting reasons. Not a murderer.                                          |
| **Role in Company**            | Thought to be low-level security, possibly mascot performer, not in management.                                         | Co-founder alongside Henry Emily; handled engineering, design, and security systems from behind the scenes.                                                                     |
| **Public Visibility**          | Seen rarely, usually in security uniform or SpringBonnie costume.                                                       | Avoided public view intentionally; let Henry & Dave handle PR. Wore uniform to avoid recognition as owner.                                                                      |
| **Connection to SpringBonnie** | Wore SpringBonnie during public events in early years — led people to connect him to later SpringBonnie-related crimes. | Only wore SpringBonnie in early, innocent promotional roles; later killings were by Dave Miller wearing the same suit.                                                          |
| **Dave Miller’s Role**         | Known publicly as a senior Fazbear operations manager and occasional security worker — seen as loyal employee.          | Dave Miller was a manipulative predator who killed Charlotte Emily, Susie, Gabriel, Jeremy, and Fritz. Used public confusion and visual similarity to frame William indirectly. |
| **Criminal Accusations**       | Public rumor tied William to child murders; assumed motive tied to company secrets.                                     | Actual murderer was Dave Miller; William was unaware of the murders until after the fact.                                                                                       |
| **PR Response**                | Fazbear Entertainment neither confirmed nor denied rumors; horror game adaptations blurred reality further.             | Company leadership (excluding William) used confusion to their advantage to avoid public panic and lawsuits.                                                                    |
| **Physical Appearance**        | Public believed William looked like Dave — white Anglo features, clean-cut.                                             | William had Italian heritage, slightly darker features, but uniform + distance from public made comparisons stick.                                                              |
