# 📅 Creator’s Note – Symbolism of Afton Birthdates

In this AU, many key members of the Afton family are born in **June or July** — and that’s not accidental. Their placement near the middle of the calendar year holds symbolic and narrative weight.

## 🌗 Liminal Timeframes
- Being born mid-year places a person between the rising heat of summer and the approach of autumn — a metaphorical “in-between” state.
- Characters like **Nico**, **Elizabeth**, and **William** are all suspended in moral or existential limbo. Are they alive? Dead? Culpable? Forgiven? The birthday placement echoes that uncertainty.

---

## 📆 Psychological Time Ambiguity
- In many real-life school systems, someone born in June or July can feel *off-cycle* — sometimes being the youngest or oldest in a class depending on the cutoff.
- The **17 this year / 15 last year** phenomenon reflects how characters like Nico or Rosario feel unstuck in time, emotionally and developmentally.

---

## 🔁 Thematic Reflection
- The entire AU is obsessed with identity erosion, time distortion, and legacy transmission.
- Mid-year birthdays symbolize transitional states — much like the Aftons themselves: stuck between science and myth, flesh and metal, love and guilt.

## 💫 Summary
These dates are more than trivia. They’re **subtle time-markers** of how fractured, haunted, and uncertain the Afton legacy really is.

“Who are you this year? Who were you last year?”

That question haunts everyone in this timeline.
