# Afton Financial Status
**Overview:**  
The Afton family is technically wealthy due to the high cost and high yield of their research, technology, and intellectual property. Much of their wealth is **circulatory** — tied into ongoing operations, reinvested into their companies / jobs.

**Key Traits:**

- **High Burn Rate:** Their projects (animatronics, remnant research, etc.) are capital intensive.
    
- **High ROI (Return on Investment):** As long as the work continues, the money flows.
    
- **Unsustainable if Inactive:** If they stop — due to death, legal interference, or ethical collapse — their net worth becomes finite and dwindles quickly.
    
- **Hidden Assets:** Some funds are off the books — in offshore accounts, bunkers, or through third-party corporate fronts.
