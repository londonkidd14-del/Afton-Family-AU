# Meta Ability Inheritance

## Summary
Metahuman abilities in this world are **rare, genetically inherited traits**, typically bound to specific bloodlines.

---

## Inheritance Rules

- **Single-Origin Traits**: If two unrelated metahumans have similar powers, they are not genetically identical (convergent evolution, not inheritance).

---

## Known Hereditary Lines

### Afton Line
- **Nexus Source**: [[Oliver_James_Afton]]
- **Photoregenesis Carrier**: [[Judith_Afton]]
- Abilities split across descendants

---

## Cultural Norms
- Powers are treated like red hair: rare, but not world-shaking
- Some families hide or suppress these traits to avoid attention
