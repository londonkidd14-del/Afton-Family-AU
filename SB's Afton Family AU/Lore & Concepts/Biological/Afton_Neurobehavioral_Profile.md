## üß† High-Cognition Behavioral Risks in Afton Bloodline

- Members of the Afton family, especially **Oliver**, **William**, and **Willow**, cognitive outputs requires near-constant stimulation, or they become restless, impulsive, or self-sabotaging. This is because people who have high intelligence, their minds process information faster and thrive on challenges that push them to think critically and creatively.¬†

- **Boredom and Frustration:**¬†Without sufficient stimulation, individuals with high intelligence can quickly become bored, frustrated, and disengaged. This can impact motivation and overall satisfaction in life.
- **Mental Well-being:**¬†Hobbies and mentally challenging activities have been shown to significantly improve mental health by reducing stress, boosting mood, enhancing focus, and fostering a sense of accomplishment. They can even help alleviate symptoms associated with depression and anxiety.
- **Cognitive Enhancement:**¬†Engaging in new and complex activities stimulates neuroplasticity ‚Äì the brain's ability to form new neural connections ‚Äì leading to improved cognitive function and helping to maintain mental acuity as we age.
- **Preventing Burnout:**¬†Hobbies offer a crucial break from daily stressors and can help prevent burnout by providing a space to unwind, recharge, and engage in enjoyable pursuits.
- **Personal Growth:**¬†Through hobbies, individuals can learn new skills, deepen existing knowledge, and continuously develop, contributing to a sense of purpose and self-discovery.

### ‚è≥ Asynchronous Development
- Emotional maturity **lags behind intellectual capacity** in all three.
- As children and teens, this led to isolation, frustration, and an overreliance on logic.
- Their inability to socially regulate their genius fostered emotional bottlenecking that persists into adulthood.

### üï≥Ô∏è Existential Gap
- All three are drawn to **meta-questions**: the nature of death, time, soul, and consequence.
- They are not easily soothed by everyday pleasures or distractions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Resulting Behaviors
- **William:** Obsession with ethical frameworks, remnant containment, and bodily mortality.
- **Willow:** Isolation through systems work, detachment masked by dry humor and compliance.
- **Oliver:** Nihilistic god complex; toggles between genius and dysfunction.
(These resulting behavior are set in stone as canon yet, so these might change)
