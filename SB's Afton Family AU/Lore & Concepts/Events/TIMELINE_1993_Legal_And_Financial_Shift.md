# TIMELINE_1993_Legal_And_Financial_Shift
**Event:** Post–Springlock Incident
**Date:** 1993

- William Afton is declared missing and later presumed dead.
- Legal guardianship of Fig and comatose Nico formally transfers to Rosario Michael Afton.
- Nicole (deceased, 1981) left no will, so Rosario inherits guardianship by default and age.
- The Afton Family's ongoing revenue streams cease without William.
- Rosario and Fig are left with only the static accounts William held at the time.
- The estate is **finite**: sufficient for short-term survival, insufficient for long-term security.
- Occasional support from Willow, Oliver, Judith, and Henry becomes vital to their stability.
