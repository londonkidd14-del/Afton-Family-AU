### ðŸ“Œ Summary:
Following William Afton's disappearance during the Springlock Incident and Nico Aftonâ€™s subsequent coma, custody of Fig Afton was transferred to Rosario Michael Afton on October 2nd, 1993. This decision was formalized by the Oregon State Child Welfare Court, with supporting affidavits from Judith and Willow Afton.

### ðŸ§  Context:
- **Rosario** was barely 28, still emotionally unraveling from recent family tragedies.
- **Fig** was just 13 at the time, entering adolescence amidst upheaval and loss.
- While the guardianship ensured legal safety, the emotional groundwork was unstable.

### ðŸ—‚ Outcomes:
- Marked a shift in family structure: from multigenerational household to fractured sibling-surrogate dynamic.
- Set the stage for future interpersonal friction, healing, and eventual mutual growth.
